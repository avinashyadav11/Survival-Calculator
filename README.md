# Survival-Calculator


<h2>Overview</h2>

This is a Python application designed to calculate how long a person has lived based on their age.

Here I have written a method that takes age as input and option where you can select options of months, weeks, days, hours,minutes, and seconds from the list to know how long you have lived your life

<h2>Features</h2>

Calculate survival age in months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds based on the age input.

Flexible input: accepts both full names and abbreviations for time units. Output displayed in the chosen time unit.

Here for the calculation part, I have simple mathematics keeping approximate in mind

Years = age * 1

Month = age * 12

Weeks = age * 52

Days = age * 365

Hours = age * 365 * 24

Minutes = age * 365 * 24 * 60

Seconds = age * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60

<h2>How to use</h2>

Input: Enter the age of a person when prompted.

Choose Time Unit: Select the desired time unit from the list (Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds).

Output: The program will calculate and display how long the person has lived in the selected time unit.
